# CAP5516_MedicalImageComputing

Welcome to the CAP5516_MedicalImageComputing repository! This repository contains my assignments and projects from the Medical Image Computing (MIC) course at the University of Central Florida (UCF).

As part of my journey in Computer Vision, I will be uploading a variety of assignments, projects, and code that showcase my work in this exciting field. You will find image processing algorithms, machine learning models, and medical image analysis implementations here.
